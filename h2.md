# Homework for week 2 from https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#homework.

## **x) Read / watch and summarize:**

### **- Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto**
[The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/#values) is like a guide for making sure computer systems are safe from bad stuff. It helps people figure out what can go wrong, how to fix it, and if they did a good job. Anyone worried about their system's security can use it. The manifesto values finding and fixing problems over just checking boxes, and it's big on people working together.
The key ideas are:
Ask what you're working on and what could go wrong.
Get everyone involved in finding and fixing issues.
Keep learning and improving instead of just talking.
Use tools that make things easier.
Avoid thinking one person can do it all and focus on practical solutions.
It's like a helpful friend for building safer computer stuff!

### **- Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course (12 parts, about 15 min total, audio is enough for all except video 7 "Data flow diagrams")**

Available to watch: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf
The goal of these videos is to introduce threat modeling. 
There are 4 questions to be asked:
1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we did a good job?

**Collaboration** is answering _what are we working on?_ For example, online drawing tools value for collaboration is that multiple people can work on the project at the same time. 

**Sketching** as part of our answer to question _what are we working on?_ This means that we are starting to put what's in our head into a form that other people can engage with, can respond to, and that we can use to answer the question _what can go wrong?_ Sketching is also the 1st part of answering the question _what are we working on?_

#### Record your Threat Modeling work!
There is a business reason to develop a document of record and we can do this in a drawing tool. That's how we can learn new things about the systems that we're working on. And we feed all the details into the question _what can go wrong?_

#### Data flow diagrams. 
Data flow diagrams are heavily assosiated with threat modeling because threats tend to follow data and because they're simple to draw and easy to use to help us understand _what are we working on?_

They have 5 symbols in them:
 - External entities,
 - data flows,
 - data stores,
 - trust boundaries,
 - process.

These 5 elements make up a data flow diagram. And it looks something like this (image is taken from the Adam Shostack [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf)).

#### STRIDE
Is adding a structure to how we answer questionn about _what can go wrong?_
One of the most important structures is a Mnemonic STRIDE. 

Image is taken from another Adam Shostack [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGkX06sVFFM&list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf&index=9)

Each of these problems on the image is a problem that occurs in systems ranging from Desktop to Software to Cloud to IoT to Mobile. So STRIDE is a fundamental way to improve our threat modeling and get better answers by thinking about each of these possible problems and ensuring that we have at least one threat for each letter (S, T, R, I, D, E). 

The set of threats that we then discover is the answer for our question _what can go wrong?_

#### Risk management
Is applied to a subset of the threats we discover in threat modeling to help us quantigy the probability or the impact, to help us make a decision about what we are going to do about it. 
Threat modeling precedes risk management and informs risk management. And that's how these 2 come togheter. 

#### Did we do a good job in threat modeling?
Ask a question: _"would you recommend threat modeling to a collegue?_
If the answer is yes - we did something good. If the answer is no, we haven't done good enough just yet..


### **- Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! â‚¬**

**Importance of Threat Modeling:**

Anyone can learn and benefit from threat modeling, as it helps to find security issues. Threat modeling involves using models to abstract details and view the bigger security picture.

The chapter emphasizes learning through hands-on experience rather than theory. Analogy with Learning an Instrument:
Threat modeling is compared to learning an instrument - it may be challenging initially, but practice improves skills over time.
The four-step breakdown of threat modeling is introduced as a practical exercise. 
The chapter guides the reader through examining a simple web application with a database to identify security flaws. Introduction to playing "Elevation of Privilege," a serious game for starting threat modeling. Hands-on experience in building a threat model is provided. The chapter concludes with a set of checklists to help readers initiate their threat modeling journey.
Emphasis on practical steps, understanding potential issues, and checking one's work in threat modeling.

### **- OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet**

Accessable: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html


## a) Security hygiene. What basic security practices should everyone follow? Are there some security hygiene practicies that you consider useful, but might be above an average Joe? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer. A bullet list is enough)

Quoting Jessica Barker ("Confident Cyber Security. The essential insights and how to protect from threats", 2023): "We must continue to strive for better foundation of security in the sytems, software and products we use. This requires a layered defence, not relying on one technical solution as the only line of defence but using many. 

    Anti-virus, firewalls, patching, careful configuration of systems, actionable monitoring and logging, appropriate authentication ans suitable encryption are 
    all part of these foundations."

I do feel like cybersecurity and information security knowledge are crucial for everyone and it only goes more crucial within passing time. I do believe that all these qualities mentioned by Jessica are as essential as anyone to make themselves familiar with Office tools, or reading an email etc. It will became basic skill that will be needed from anyone. Or at least it should. In my opinion. 

## b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.
This subtask does not require tests with a computer.
A long, extensive answer with narrative, analysis and a diagram is expected.
Create an imaginary company and create threat model.
Business requirements come from business, technical specialist help with tech. Inlude this in your narrative.
Your analysis should cover all parts of the four question model (four key questions in Threat modeling manifesto)
(1) What are we working on?
Our assets
Priorization, key assets
E.g. customer health data is a crown jevel, personel gaming server is probably not
Security supports business
Draw a diagram of the company systems
Write a description.
(2) What can go wrong?
Apply one or more named models: Attack trees, STRIDE, ATT&CK...
Give some examples of identified risks - you don't need to find all risks or likely vulnerabilites, as there would be too many for this homework.
Priorize biggest risks
High expected value (or other very high risk)
Expected value = probability * monetary value
Expected value is a tool for discussion, it's not exact science as we have to guestimate the input numbers
Are you targetted by specific threat actors?
Known TTPs? (tactics, techniques, procedures)
COI - Capability, Opportunity, Intent
(3) What are we going to do about it?
Can you: reduce attack surface, limit entry points...
Reduce, transfer, avoid, accept
(4) Did we do a good enough job?
Security audits, pentests, assesments, continous threat modeling and evaluation
