# Homework for week 2 from https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#homework.

## **x) Read / watch and summarize:**

### **- Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto**
[The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/#values) is like a guide for making sure computer systems are safe from bad stuff. It helps people figure out what can go wrong, how to fix it, and if they did a good job. Anyone worried about their system's security can use it. The manifesto values finding and fixing problems over just checking boxes, and it's big on people working together.
The key ideas are:
Ask what you're working on and what could go wrong.
Get everyone involved in finding and fixing issues.
Keep learning and improving instead of just talking.
Use tools that make things easier.
Avoid thinking one person can do it all and focus on practical solutions.
It's like a helpful friend for building safer computer stuff!

### **- OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet**

Accessable: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html


## a) Security hygiene. What basic security practices should everyone follow? Are there some security hygiene practicies that you consider useful, but might be above an average Joe? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer. A bullet list is enough)


## b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.
This subtask does not require tests with a computer.
A long, extensive answer with narrative, analysis and a diagram is expected.
Create an imaginary company and create threat model.
Business requirements come from business, technical specialist help with tech. Inlude this in your narrative.
Your analysis should cover all parts of the four question model (four key questions in Threat modeling manifesto)
(1) What are we working on?
Our assets
Priorization, key assets
E.g. customer health data is a crown jevel, personel gaming server is probably not
Security supports business
Draw a diagram of the company systems
Write a description.
(2) What can go wrong?
Apply one or more named models: Attack trees, STRIDE, ATT&CK...
Give some examples of identified risks - you don't need to find all risks or likely vulnerabilites, as there would be too many for this homework.
Priorize biggest risks
High expected value (or other very high risk)
Expected value = probability * monetary value
Expected value is a tool for discussion, it's not exact science as we have to guestimate the input numbers
Are you targetted by specific threat actors?
Known TTPs? (tactics, techniques, procedures)
COI - Capability, Opportunity, Intent
(3) What are we going to do about it?
Can you: reduce attack surface, limit entry points...
Reduce, transfer, avoid, accept
(4) Did we do a good enough job?
Security audits, pentests, assesments, continous threat modeling and evaluation
