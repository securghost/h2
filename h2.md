# [Homework for week 2](https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#homework).

## **x) Read / watch and summarize:**

### **- Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto**
[The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/#values) is like a guide for making sure computer systems are safe from bad stuff. It helps people figure out what can go wrong, how to fix it, and if they did a good job. Anyone worried about their system's security can use it. The manifesto values finding and fixing problems over just checking boxes, and it's big on people working together.
The key ideas are:
Ask what you're working on and what could go wrong.
Get everyone involved in finding and fixing issues.
Keep learning and improving instead of just talking.
Use tools that make things easier.
Avoid thinking one person can do it all and focus on practical solutions.
It's like a helpful friend for building safer computer stuff!

### **- Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course (12 parts, about 15 min total, audio is enough for all except video 7 "Data flow diagrams")**

Available to watch: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf
The goal of these videos is to introduce threat modeling. 
There are 4 questions to be asked:
1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we did a good job?

**Collaboration** is answering _what are we working on?_ For example, online drawing tools value for collaboration is that multiple people can work on the project at the same time. 

**Sketching** as part of our answer to question _what are we working on?_ This means that we are starting to put what's in our head into a form that other people can engage with, can respond to, and that we can use to answer the question _what can go wrong?_ Sketching is also the 1st part of answering the question _what are we working on?_

#### Record your Threat Modeling work!
There is a business reason to develop a document of record and we can do this in a drawing tool. That's how we can learn new things about the systems that we're working on. And we feed all the details into the question _what can go wrong?_

#### Data flow diagrams. 
Data flow diagrams are heavily assosiated with threat modeling because threats tend to follow data and because they're simple to draw and easy to use to help us understand _what are we working on?_

They have 5 symbols in them:
 - External entities,
 - data flows,
 - data stores,
 - trust boundaries,
 - process.

These 5 elements make up a data flow diagram. And it looks something like this (image is taken from the Adam Shostack [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf)).

#### STRIDE
Is adding a structure to how we answer questionn about _what can go wrong?_
One of the most important structures is a Mnemonic STRIDE. 

Image is taken from another Adam Shostack [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGkX06sVFFM&list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf&index=9)

Each of these problems on the image is a problem that occurs in systems ranging from Desktop to Software to Cloud to IoT to Mobile. So STRIDE is a fundamental way to improve our threat modeling and get better answers by thinking about each of these possible problems and ensuring that we have at least one threat for each letter (S, T, R, I, D, E). 

The set of threats that we then discover is the answer for our question _what can go wrong?_

#### Risk management
Is applied to a subset of the threats we discover in threat modeling to help us quantigy the probability or the impact, to help us make a decision about what we are going to do about it. 
Threat modeling precedes risk management and informs risk management. And that's how these 2 come togheter. 

#### Did we do a good job in threat modeling?
Ask a question: _"would you recommend threat modeling to a collegue?_
If the answer is yes - we did something good. If the answer is no, we haven't done good enough just yet..


### **- Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! €**

**Importance of Threat Modeling:**

Anyone can learn and benefit from threat modeling, as it helps to find security issues. Threat modeling involves using models to abstract details and view the bigger security picture.

The chapter emphasizes learning through hands-on experience rather than theory. Analogy with Learning an Instrument:
Threat modeling is compared to learning an instrument - it may be challenging initially, but practice improves skills over time.
The four-step breakdown of threat modeling is introduced as a practical exercise. 
The chapter guides the reader through examining a simple web application with a database to identify security flaws. Introduction to playing "Elevation of Privilege," a serious game for starting threat modeling. Hands-on experience in building a threat model is provided. The chapter concludes with a set of checklists to help readers initiate their threat modeling journey.
Emphasis on practical steps, understanding potential issues, and checking one's work in threat modeling.

 - Have we written down or filed a bug for each threat?
 - Is there a proposed/planned/implemented way to address each threat?
 - Do we have a test case per threat?
 - Has the software passed the test?
 - Threat modeling involves the intersection of two models: a model of what can go wrong (threats) applied to a model of the software, usually encoded in a diagram.
 - STRIDE (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege) provides a model of threats, which can be addressed using mitigation strategies and techniques.
 - The Elevation of Privilege game adds structure and hints to the threat model, making it accessible to technical professionals across different skill sets.
 - It's crucial to address threats and validate the threat model to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the software's security implications.

### **- OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet**

Accessable: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html

After identifying possible threats, each threat must be ranked based on its likelihood and impact. The response to these threats can take the following forms:

   - **Mitigate:** Take action to reduce the likelihood of the threat materializing.
   - **Eliminate:** Remove the feature or component causing the threat.
   - **Transfer:** Shift responsibility to another entity, such as the customer.
   - **Accept:** Choose not to mitigate, eliminate, or transfer the risk due to business requirements or constraints.

Mitigation responses must be actionable and tailored to the specific application. Mitigation strategies can be formulated and documented as requirements, either at the category or individual threat level, based on the complexity of the system and nature of the threats.

The threat model must undergo a comprehensive review by all stakeholders. The key areas to focus on during the review include:

 - Ensuring that the DFD accurately reflects the system.
 - Confirming the identification of all threats and the agreement on response strategies for each.
 - Developing mitigation strategies that reduce risk to an acceptable level for identified threats.
 - Formal documentation of the threat model and storage of artifacts for accessibility by relevant stakeholders.
 - Testing the agreed-upon mitigations and measuring the success or failure of the requirements and recommendations from the threat model.

This review and validation process ensures that the threat model is robust and that all stakeholders are aligned in addressing the identified threats effectively.


## a) Security hygiene. What basic security practices should everyone follow? Are there some security hygiene practicies that you consider useful, but might be above an average Joe? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer. A bullet list is enough)

Quoting Jessica Barker ("Confident Cyber Security. The essential insights and how to protect from threats", 2023): "We must continue to strive for better foundation of security in the sytems, software and products we use. This requires a layered defence, not relying on one technical solution as the only line of defence but using many. 

    "Anti-virus, firewalls, patching, careful configuration of systems, actionable monitoring and logging, appropriate authentication
    and suitable encryption are all part of these foundations." (Barker, 2023)

I do feel like cybersecurity and information security knowledge are crucial for everyone and it only goes more crucial within passing time. I do believe that all these qualities mentioned by Jessica are as essential as anyone to make themselves familiar with Office tools, or reading an email etc. Also, the knowledge of how and with what to analyse your Network and to recognize any suspicious access to ones devices is quite crucial. It will became basic skill that will be needed from anyone. Or at least it should. In my opinion. 

## b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.
This subtask does not require tests with a computer.
A long, extensive answer with narrative, analysis and a diagram is expected.
Create an imaginary company and create threat model.
Business requirements come from business, technical specialist help with tech. Inlude this in your narrative.
Your analysis should cover all parts of the four question model (four key questions in Threat modeling manifesto)
(1) What are we working on?
Our assets
Priorization, key assets
E.g. customer health data is a crown jevel, personel gaming server is probably not
Security supports business
Draw a diagram of the company systems
Write a description.
(2) What can go wrong?
Apply one or more named models: Attack trees, STRIDE, ATT&CK...
Give some examples of identified risks - you don't need to find all risks or likely vulnerabilites, as there would be too many for this homework.
Priorize biggest risks
High expected value (or other very high risk)
Expected value = probability * monetary value
Expected value is a tool for discussion, it's not exact science as we have to guestimate the input numbers
Are you targetted by specific threat actors?
Known TTPs? (tactics, techniques, procedures)
COI - Capability, Opportunity, Intent
(3) What are we going to do about it?
Can you: reduce attack surface, limit entry points...
Reduce, transfer, avoid, accept
(4) Did we do a good enough job?
Security audits, pentests, assesments, continous threat modeling and evaluation

Asked an example for [Chatsonic](app.writesonic.com), so I would comprehend better the task in hand and could make some examples out of it. 
It's solution was about SecureTech Solutions within an introduction as "In response to growing cybersecurity threats, SecureTech Solutions is a fictional company specializing in providing cutting-edge security solutions to businesses worldwide. The company's mission is to safeguard its clients' digital assets and sensitive information from malicious actors, ensuring a secure and resilient digital environment."

 - **Website Downtime:** High impact on business operations and revenue.
 - **Malicious Advertisements:** Moderate expected value considering potential impact on user trust.
 - **Third-Party Vulnerabilities:** Moderate to high expected value based on the severity of potential vulnerabilities.

    
    **Q: What is considered as sensitive customer data?**
   
    **A:** Sensitive customer data typically includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, social
    security numbers, credit card numbers, and other financial information. This also encompasses any data that, if compromised, could lead to identity theft,
    financial fraud, or other privacy violations.

    **Q: About the website downtime  - can we, as a paying customer and not e develpor nor the owner of the website, can still use that DDos protection, redundant
    hosting infrastructure, and proactive monitoring to mitigate potential downtime risks and how?**
   
    **A:** As a paying customer utilizing hosting services, you can inquire with your hosting provider about the availability of DDoS protection and redundant
    hosting infrastructure for your website. Many hosting providers offer these services as part of their hosting packages. Proactive monitoring can also be
    provided by the hosting company or through the use of third-party monitoring services. It's important to discuss these options with your hosting provider to
    understand the extent of protection and monitoring they offer.

    **Q: By Malicious advertisement, do you mean that a hacker can hack into our webpage and put some malicious links instead of our real ones? And if so, how can
    we check and make sure, that we have not been attacked like that.**
   
    **A:** Yes, malicious advertisements can involve hackers compromising a website to inject harmful links or ads that can potentially lead to security breaches 
    for
    site visitors. To mitigate this risk, it's important to implement stringent vetting of affiliate links and advertisements before they are integrated into the
    website. Additionally, continuous monitoring for potential security threats, such as using security plugins and conducting regular security scans, can help in
    detecting and preventing the inclusion of malicious content on the website. It's also advisable to stay updated with the latest security practices and to
    promptly address any security vulnerabilities that are identified.

    **Q: Stringent vetting - could you define that for me?**
   
   **A:** Stringent vetting refers to the thorough and rigorous evaluation or screening process applied to assess the suitability, integrity, and security of
    something, such as affiliate links, advertisements, or any content that is being considered for use or integration into a system or platform.
    In the context of affiliate marketing, stringent vetting involves meticulous scrutiny of the links and advertisements to ensure that they meet certain
    criteria, such as authenticity, relevance, and security. This process can include verifying the legitimacy of the affiliate links, assessing the reputation of
    the advertisers, and examining the content for potential security risks or malicious intent. Additionally, stringent vetting may involve adherence to specific
    guidelines or standards set by the company to maintain the integrity and security of its platform and protect its users from potential threats.

    **Q: And in simple English?**
   
    **A:** In simple terms, stringent vetting means carefully checking and evaluating things, like links or advertisements, to make sure they are safe, 
    trustworthy, and relevant before using them on a website. It involves being very thorough and cautious when deciding which links or ads to include, to ensure
    they are genuine and won't cause any harm to the website or its visitors.
